# We use git-buildpackage's dch subcommand to generate a changelog
# containing git commit information. While not as good as a hand
# edited changelog, it contains enough information to help testers
# understand which changes are contained in the package.
#
# We use gbp-dch to set a version number based on the commit date
# and git commit id.

# If we are building for a tag, we generate final release packages:
#   * Leave the changelog entries as they are
#   * If a backport, generate a backport changelog entry
#
# = Distribution flag =
# In all cases, we want to make sure that the distribution name
# is set. This is to ensure that reprepro assigns the package to
# the correct distribution. We determine the distribution
# using lsb_release.
