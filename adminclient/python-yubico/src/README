  Introduction
================

The YubiKey is a hardware token for authentication. The main
mode of the YubiKey is entering a one time password (or a strong
static password) by acting as a USB HID device, but there are
things one can do with bi-directional communication.

  1) Configuration. The yubikey_config class should be a feature-
     wise complete implementation of everything that can be
     configured on YubiKeys version 1.3 to 2.2 (besides deprecated
     functions in YubiKey 1.x).

     See examples/configure_nist_test_key for an example.

  2) Challenge-response. YubiKey 2.2 supports HMAC-SHA1 or Yubico
     challenge-response operations.

     See examples/nist_challenge_response for an example.

    Example
================

Here is a trivial usage example :

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    """ Get version of connected YubiKey. """

    import sys
    import yubico.yubikey

    debug = False

    try:
        YK = yubico.yubikey.find_key(debug=debug)
	print "Version : %s " % YK.version()
    except yubico.yubico_exception.YubicoError as inst:
	print "ERROR: %s" % inst.value
        sys.exit(1)


================
  Installation
================

You should be able to install python-yubico in the standard-python way,
which seems to be

  $ cd python-yubico-$ver
  $ python setup.py install

although I've never tried this myself. I use Ubuntu, so I created a
PPA (Personal Package Archive) for easy installation (and removal) on
Ubuntu systems.

If you use a recent Ubuntu release, you should be able to install
python-yubico with these commands :

  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fredrikt/python-yubico
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install python-yubico

The Launchpad PPA key generated for my packages is C7E50642.
