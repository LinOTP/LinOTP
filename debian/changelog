linotp (3.2.3-1) buster; urgency=low

  Fixes:
  * ensure all types of token will be migrated
  * ensure that dbconfig-common triggers the linotp database migration
  * Customisation of /manage and /selfservice-legacy was broken due to
  url path changes with LinOTP 3

linotp (3.2.2-1) buster; urgency=low

  Fixes:
  * Challenge database is reset once to ensure that Backups pre LinOTP 3
    correctly restore existing challenge-response tokens.
  * Migrate encypted data 'password' with legacy proprietary padding (LinOTP 2.9)
  * Fix migration of yubico token to LinOTP 3.2

linotp (3.2.1-1) buster; urgency=low

  Fixes:
  * Audit key verification errors solved by using newer version of pycryptodomex.
  * Remove weak file permissions in config dir.
  * Solved migration of QR-tokens which broke backup-restore from SVA-2.12.5 to SVA-3.0
  * Database re-encoding during database migration now also migrates
    managed users that were previously not correctly migrated.
  * Debian postinst trying to add admin users via htdigest. This is no longer supported
    and therefore removed. Use the linotp CLI manually instead.
  * Ensure that inactive policies are not evaluated. Previously, inactive policies were
    being evaluated in certain situations, leading to wrongly attributed permissions to
    logged-in administrators.

 -- LinOTP Packaging <packaging@linotp.de>  Fri, 15 Jul 2022 18:30:00 +0100

linotp (3.2-1) buster; urgency=low

  Breaking Changes:
  * The helpdesk controller has been removed.
  * Apache-based admin authentication is no longer supported.
  * Audit Trail export is now ordered descending (latest logs first) when
    done from the Manage-UI.
  * Admin authentication: 'Cross site scripting request forgery (CSRF)' is no longer
    handled via the session request parameter. Instead, a CSRF-protection token, which is
    available via cookies, must be sent in the request header. Non-modifying requests
    can be requested via 'GET' and do not need to send the CSRF token. The session parameter
    that was used before should be omitted. API endpoints restricted to accept only via 'POST'
    must use the new header. See the Migration guide for further details.
  * Some API endpoints are now restricted to the specific HTTP method which they can be used with.
    Endpoints requiring an admin authentication are now restricted to the POST method if they
    are modifying data. The allowed HTTP methods are highlighted in the API documentation.
  * Logging has more configurations now whose config variables are starting by LOG like LOG_FOO. Different
    formatting or log level can be set for the LOG_FILE or the LOG_CONSOLE. Some of the older config
    variables for logging are renamed for consistency.

  Deprecations:
  * In the future, all API endpoints will only allow certain HTTP methods. Data-modifying
    endpoints - that are not restricted yet- will only allow POST requests in the future,
    and read-only endpoints will only allow GET requests. The now deprecated HTTP methods
    are also highlighted in the API documentation.

  Fixes:
  * License limits are now enforced during userservice token enrollment.
  * Prevent creating or importing OATH (HOTP, TOTP, Ocra2) tokens with malformatted seeds.
  * License monitoring shows license usage for user-based licenses.
  * User-based license reporting now filters for date and realm correctly and supports wildcards
    in realm and status.
  * In a Debian environment with a MySQL database, it is not anymore required
    to set the charset=utf8 parameter as otherwise, resolvers would not
    correctly display imported users if they contain utf-8 characters.
    Using flask- mysqlalchemy connection solved this problem.
  * License exception messages are improved and in case of the user service the
    message suggests asking the system administrator.
  * Comprehensive message after importing tokens.
  * Adjusted functional_special tests to become regular tests.
  * Porting issue for radius token with forwarding transactions.
  * Reply to sms challenge with pin+otp.
  * User import now always deletes users in the correct managed resolver.
  * The linotp support cmd can now install demo licenses.
  * The linotp cli commands would not break anymore if localization is involved.
  * Resolver names are treated as case-sensitive.
  * setConfig is now called from the UI only once to save all parameters in one api call.
  * Audit key verification errors solved by using newer version of pycryptodomex.

  Features:
  * Added grace to license volume exceeding and display accordingly a message
    in the the web ui.
  * Added extended information in HOTP/TOTP CSV import UI.
  * The CLI now uses a common time format for all backup filenames. The format
    is configurable via config BACKUP_FILE_TIME_FORMAT.
  * CLI command `linotp audit cleanup` now writes a backup file of the deleted
    audit entries by default. Export dir defaults to the LinOTP backup dir.
    Exporting can be disabled with a new flag --no-export.
  * Added the configuration option for the HttpSmsProvider to define the server
    certificate verification option.
  * Added a jwt based admin authentication into LinOTP, so that configuring
    apache to protect admin access to linotp is not needed any more.
    Linotp therefore uses a special realm, the admin realm, which contains the
    resolvers that are allowed to adminstrate LinOTP. For bootstraping, an
    internal reserved managed resolver is used for which users could be added via
    the linotp command line tool (s. README.md). The Manage-ui and the
    corresponding interfaces have been extended to indicate if a realm or
    resolver is used for administration.
  * Prevent overwriting of the local admin resolver via the user import.
  * New linotp admin cli command to set support license, get support info
    and verify the current support status.
  * Endpoint delRealm does not cause Error if no realm argument is passed
  * Added configuration settings JWT_SECRET_KEY, JWT_SECRET_SALT, and
    JWT_SECRET_ITERATIONS. The latter two control the PBKDF2 function that
    is applied to the default secret (the first key from SECRET_FILE) if
    JWT_SECRET_KEY is not given or is empty. Refer to `linotp config explain`
    for details.
  * Email challenge can have a custom message for the user which can be set
    in the config by the EMAIL_CHALLENGE_PROMPT entry.
  * Extended sms provider logging
  * Added TIMEOUT parameter for all networking providers
  * SMS blocking time is now configurable in the SMS token configuration dialog.
    The blocking time (in seconds) is the period that needs to pass before another
    challenge can be triggered by the same user.
  * Admin policies now support resolver defintion for admin users
  * A new API endpoint /manage/context provides context information for logged in
    Manage-UI users.
  * Reimplement additional getToken safeguard by defining the settings
    DISABLE_CONTROLLERS and ENABLE_CONTROLLERS - by default the
    DISABLE_CONTROLLERS contains the 'gettoken' controller.
  * admin policies now support resolver defintion for admin users

  Dependencies
  * Update jQuery and jQuery-Migrate

  Packaging:
  * The `linotp` package now `Suggests: python3-smpplib`.

linotp (3.1-1) buster; urgency=medium

  Features:
  * ManageUI policy editor utilizes full window width for improved layout.
  * Inform the admin via audit log if there is an challenge integrity error.
  * Userservice allows enrollment of HOTP tokens with the webprovisionGOOGLE policy.
  * Userservice allows enrollment of TOTP tokens with the webprovisionGOOGLEtime policy.
  * RestSMSProvider allows access to nested JSON request data structure items by path.
  * Use database config value to enable get_otp feature
  * Simplify the HMAC acountname and tokenissuer fallback rules for a more predictable
    behavior in the google authenticator url.
  * Token monitoring now better sanitizes the status parameter
  * Improved Manage-UI error message if something fails in the initial config
    load phase.
  * sqlite can be used as audit database - the response of audit/search
    now skips streaming the response data for sqlite audit databases.
  * The server now checks whether the audit table exists or not on start.

  Breaking changes:
  * No longer support AUDIT_POOL_RECYCLE configuration setting.
  * Sqlite audit databases can no longer share the same file with LinOTP. If configured
    to share the same file, LinOTP will add a suffix to the audit database file name.
  * Audit database timestamp is now ISO 8601 formatted. The timestamp is saved in UTC
    timezone instead of server local time.

  Fixes:
  * mOTP tokens can now be used in challenge response mode
  * Adjust yubico token config text to make it clear that a dedicated
    API key from yubico is required.
  * An error message is now shown in the Manage UI if a token import fails
  * API /admin/testconnection accepts only the name of an existing resolver as
    parameter. Other parameters are ignored. This fixes the ability to submit
    unauthorized ldap connection requests.
  * Manage-UI no longer hangs on failed resolver save requests.
  * Token monitoring now correctly counts tokens that are assigned to multiple realms
    only once in mysql and sqlite databases.
  * Dynamic user data (e.g. e-mail addresses and phone numbers) are always
    refreshed during resolver lookups triggered by the authentication workflow.
    The policies sms_dynamic_mobile_number, dynamic_email_address, and
    voice_dynamic_mobile_number therefore directly reflect external user data
    changes.
  * Remove references to the deactivated newsletter and former company names
  * Legacy Selfservice now correctly recognizes type=yubikey tokens in MFA login.
  * Manage-UI no longer gets stuck in the interface initializtaion if the logged
    in user is missing required admin permissions. Now, it is guaranteed that a
    logout is always possible.
  * support the assignment of multiple tokens within one request to
    prevent raceconditions for example with token_count policies
  * getotp view is now working with python3
  * Token validity period (stored in UTC) is now compared against current
    time in UTC instead of the server's timezone.
  * Log username, realm, serial and token type in audit table when performing a
    `validate/check_status` request.
  * Fix padding of crypted data by migrating to pkcs7 padding
    via the `linotp init database` command.
  * Validate no longer wrongly references autoenrollment for users that do
    not own any tokens as the error message.

 -- LinOTP Packaging <packaging@linotp.de>  Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:47:35 +0200

linotp (3.0-1) buster; urgency=medium

  Features:
  * LinOTP is ported from Python 2.7 to Python 3.6.
  * LinOTP is ported from Pylons to Flask.
  * Use the LinOTP database connection for managed resolvers to allow managed
    resolvers to work with replicated databases and after restores on different
    database connections.
  * New Token Selfservice user interface is installed as a recommended
    dependency for "/selfservice". The existing SelfService is deprecated but
    still available under /selfservice-legacy.
  * New config value SITE_ROOT_REDIRECT allows to customize the redirect
    path if the user requests the site root path ("/"). If not set, the browser
    is redirected to the legacy selfservice. The new Selfservice will pick
    priority over the deprecated Selfservice if installed.
  * Support reencoding of LinOTP 2 databases from ISO 8859-1 (Latin1) to UTF-8
    via the LinOTP CLI. Latin1 used to be the default for Python 2 against mysql
    but is no longer valid for Python 3.
  * Selfservice supports testing tokens after enrollment via the policy
    `verify`. This feature only works in the new Selfservice.
  * Selfservice improved handling of expired sessions.
  * A new 'linotp' CLI installed on the path provides:
    * admin - administrative commands to manage the linotp application server.
    * audit - administrative commands to manage the audit log.
    * backup - manage database backups.
    * config - configuration file diagnostics.
    * dbsnapshot - Manage system-independent database 'snapshots'.
    * init - key generation and database initialisation/migration.
    * ldap-test - extensive testing of LDAP backends.
    * routes - show the available URL endpoints of LinOTP.
    * run - run a development server.
    * shell - run a shell in the app context.
  * Settings can now be configured using environment variables
    LINOTP_<SETTING_NAME>.
  * Improved config file handling via LINOTP_CFG environment variable:
    * LINOTP_CFG env allows to set a custom search path for config files.
    * `/usr/share/linotp/linotp.cfg` contains distribution default settings.
    * Support for wildcard paths.
    * By default, `/etc/linotp/linotp.cfg` and `/etc/linotp/conf.d/*.cfg` are
      configured for adminsistrator configuration overrides.
    * LINOTP_CFG env treats directory `/foo` like `/foo/*.cfg`.
    * Read config file list from file if `LINOTP_CFG` doesn't exist.
  * Support for SoftHSMv2.
  * Migration of standalone scripts to linotp CLI subcommands:
    * `linotp-backup` is now available as `linotp backup create`.
    * `linotp-restore` is now available as `linotp backup restore`.
    * `linotp-create-enckey` is now available as `linotp init enc-key`.
  * Improved path settings. See DEVELOP.md on how the new options ROOT_DIR,
    CACHE_DIR, DATA_DIR, and LOGFILE_DIR are used and how they are configured by
    default.
  * Improved error code separation to differentiate between different problems
    preventing token enrollment.
  * The `/userservice/enroll` API now honors default values for hotp and totp
    tokens defined by the folowing selfservice policies:
    * hmac_otplen, totp_otplen: for the number of digits of an OTP.
    * hmac_hashlib, totp_hashlib: the HMAC hashing algorithm used.
    * totp_timestep: the time stepping for totp tokens.
  * Customization of Selfservice information fields via policies:
    * footer_text: Can be used to display e.g. copyright notices.
    * imprint_url: URL to an imprint/ legal notice page.
    * privacy_notice: URL to a privacy notice page.

  Removed and no longer supported:
  * Support for Debian versions before buster.
  * Apache 2.2 configuration.
  * linotp.ini configuration file format.
  * non-systemd init script.
  * OCRA token.
  * Vasco token.
  * OSIAM SCIM UserIdResolver.
  * The following tools scripts are no longer part of LinOTP:
    * linotp-auth-radius
    * linotp-convert-gemalto
    * linotp-convert-token
    * linotp-convert-xml-to-CSV
    * linotp-create-ad-users
    * linotp-create-auditkeys
    * linotp-create-certificate
    * linotp-create-database
    * linotp-create-pwidresolver-user
    * linotp-create-sqlidresolver-user
    * linotp-decrypt-otpkey
    * linotp-enroll-smstoken
    * linotp-fix-access-rights
    * linotp-pip-update
    * linotp-qrtoken-shell.py
    * linotp-setpins
    * linotp-sql-janitor
    * linotp-token-usage
    * linotp-tokens-used
    * testRadiusChallResponse.sh
    * totp-token
  * Predefined yubico apiKey and apiId placeholder values.

  Breaking changes:
  * Translations fr, it, es, and zh are removed because of their bad state.
  * LinOTP no longer accepts custom LDAP trusted certificates in the
    UserIDREsolver interface. Instead, it now fully relies on the system trusted
    certificates.
  * LDAP resolver connections to "ldap://" URLs with encryption switched off no
    longer attempt "stealth" encryption behind the user's back with an optional
    fallback to a plain connection. Instead, the encryption state can be
    explicitly controlled. (In the UI, the LDAP resolver dialog now defaults to
    "use STARTTLS" when an "ldap://" URL is specified, but if the user deselects
    this then TLS will not be used at all.)
  * LinOTP 3.0 removes all existing audit log entries during automatic database
    migrations because signatures from old audit log entries - written in
    LinOTP 2.x (using Python 2) - can not be validated with python 3.
  * Replace unmaintained mysql driver with mysqlclient driver.
  * LinOTP no longer works with ISO 8859-1 (Latin1) encoded databases. LinOTP
    provides a migration path if it detects a database that might require
    reencoding.
  * LinOTP no longer initilizes all required data automatically on startup to
    increase server speed. Instead, the server now only performs a simple
    database check at startup; the `linotp init database` command must be run
    manually if the database check fails. The postinst script will still
    initialize the database though.

  Fixes:
  * `/gettoken/getotp` now works on tokens that are not in a realm.
  * LinOTP legacy Selfservice authorization is now correctly responding with
    an "unauthorized" http response instead of an internal server error.
  * After enrollment, Push- and QR-Token enrollment status will stay completed
    even when these tokens are disabled.
  * CSV user import now works correctly with files using quote escaping.
  * Ensure consistent policy behaviour in all scopes:
    * Specific policies override wildcard policies. This ensures that actions
      can be restricted for a subset of users.
    * Fix quoting of actions such as sms_text="Hello, your otp='<otp>'".
    * All actions are matched for a given user if some of the actions are less
      explicitly defined regarding user and realm fields.
  * User based license evaluation now correctly only counts distinct users.
  * Translate maxtoken errors correctly.
  * Changing the totp time step for an existing token now adjusts the otp
    counter to allow the token to keep working. The otp counter is used to
    prevent replay attacks.
  * Unintentional inclusion of file config values in Config database is removed
    to not have security critical information API accessible.

  Packaging:
  * Include README.md in packaging artifacts.
  * Ensure configuration files and generated directories are owned by the
    linotp service user.
  * Support added to set up linotp with postgres in postinst through migration
    to dbconfig-common for database setup.
  * Downgrade mysql dependency to Recommends. The system administrator should
    install the package for their database or allow apt to install recommended
    packages.
