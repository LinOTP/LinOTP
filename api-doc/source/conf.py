# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file does only contain a selection of the most common options. For a
# full list see the documentation:
# http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/config


# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("../linotp"))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = "LinOTP API"
copyright = "2020, arxes-tolina GmbH"
author = "arxes-tolina GmbH"

# The short X.Y version
version = "3.0"
# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
release = "3.0"


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# If your documentation needs a minimal Sphinx version, state it here.
#
# needs_sphinx = '1.0'

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
]

# Add modules here that need to be mocked in order to build the API
# documentation.
#
# MOCK_MODULES = []
# for mod_name in MOCK_MODULES:
#     sys.modules[mod_name] = mock.Mock()

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ["_templates"]

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = ["build", "Thumbs.db", ".DS_Store"]


# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = "linotp-api"

# Add any paths that contain custom themes here, relative to this directory.
html_theme_path = ["themes"]

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
# html_static_path = ['_static']  # We don't need this right now, maybe later
