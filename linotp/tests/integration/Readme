Dependencies
============================================

You need to install all test dependencies listed in setup.py

I recommend creating a virtualenv and installing the dependencies there:

 $ mkdir /opt/selenium-venv
 $ virtualenv /opt/selenium-venv
 $ source /opt/selenium-venv/bin/activate
 $ pip install -e ".[test]"

If you are not using a remote instance, you also need an X-Server on your
machine (or a virtual framebuffer such as xvfb) and Firefox or Chrome.

When using a virtual framebuffer set the $DISPLAY env variable before
executing the tests.


Server Configuration file
============================================

To run the LinOTP Selenium Tests you need a server.cfg file.

A default file is available in the repository: server_cfg.ini


Chrome driver
============================================

The Chrome Selenium driver (for Google Chrome or Chromium) is faster and is
therefore used by default.

You can specify a different driver by editing the config file (server_cfg.ini)
or using the option --tc=selenium.driver:firefox


To install the Chrome driver on Ubuntu (14.04 and higher) follow these steps:

 $ sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver
 $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver

On Debian Jessie or higher, the Chrome driver package is named
'chromedriver'. Execute the following commands for installation:

 $ sudo apt-get install chromedriver
 $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver

If the Chrome driver is not available in your package management system, use
these steps:
 $ cd /usr/local/bin/

Check for the latest Chromium driver:
  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

At time of writing, the newest chromedriver is version 85. Execute the
following commands to install it on your system:

 $ wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/85.0.4183.87/chromedriver_linux64.zip
 $ unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
 $ rm chromedriver_linux64.zip
 $ mv chromedriver chromedriver-2.16
 $ chmod 755 chromedriver-2.16
 $ ln -s chromedriver-2.16 chromedriver

If you want to install the driver in a different location, you can use the environment
variable `webdriver_executable_path`:

 $ export webdriver_executable_path=/home/user/bin/chromedriver

If not already available under chromium-browser link your google chrome browser to chromium-browser

 $ cd /usr/bin/
 $ ln -s chromium-browser google-chrome


Remote driver
============================================

The remote setting allows testing within a remote Selenium or
Selenium grid. It can also be used to test against the
standalone Docker images supplied by the Selenium project.

To enable remote, the configuration should add:

 remote = True

Optionally, a remote URL can be specified in the form:

 remote_url = http://selenium-grid:4444/wd/hub

The driver setting will be used to determine which driver is
requested from the remote instance.


Execution
============================================

To execute all tests:

 $ pytest --tc-file=server_cfg.ini

To execute all tests in one file:

 $ pytest --tc-file=server_cfg.ini test_create_useridresolvers.py

It is possible to overwrite some specific configuration settings as follows:

 $ pytest --tc-file=server_cfg.ini --tc=<SECTION>.<NAME>:<VALUE>

See the configuration file for the parameters that can be set.

For example, to execute tests by connecting to a remotely running linotp instance:

 $ pytest --tc-file=server_cfg.ini --tc=linotp.host:10.76.124.35


Analysing and debugging
============================================

An example to execute tests in a single file using the trace module to show the
time at each step of the tests:

 $ python -m trace -g --trace --ignore-module=os,sys,re --ignore-dir=/usr/lib \
	/usr/bin/pytest -s --tc-file=server_local.ini -v \
	--logging-filter=-requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpool \
	--debug=selenium.webdriver.remote.remote_connection \
	test_manage.py

For interactive debugging, you can use pdb or the pudb debugger, which
can be installed via:

 $ pip install pytest-pudb

Use the debugger as follows:

 $ pytest --pudb --tc-file=server_cfg.ini test_create_useridresolvers.py


Container-based selenium testing
================================

To run the selenium tests in a docker-compose setup, the containers must be
built in the project root directory via:

  $ make -f Makefile docker-build-all

You need to set some environment variables to build against our internal
servers because some dependencies may not be up to date publicly. We also
set them for our CI pipeline in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

  $ export DEPENDENCY_DEB_REPO="http://debs-devel.corp.linotp.de/linotp3 buster linotp"
  $ export DEPENDENCY_GPG_KEY_URL="http://avocado.corp.lsexperts.de/deb-repo/ki-archive-keyring.gpg"
  $ export DEPENDENCY_GPG_KEYID=""

After you have successfully built the containers, go back to the integration test dir:

  $ cd linotp/tests/integration

Now, you can either run all tests by just *up* the compose stack or you can prepare a
shell to manually execute tests later when you have connected to the vnc server to view
what the browser does during the tests:

  $ docker-compose up # run all tests

or

  $ docker-compose run --rm selenium_tester bash # to prepare the shell for manual execution

Note, that the run command will also start a LinOTP server and the selenium container because
of the dependencies configured in `docker-compose.yml`.

To be able to visually inspect the browser during the tests, we need to find out what the
exposed port of the selenium chrome container is to be able to connect to the vnc server:

  $ docker-compose port selenium 5900

The result is the host+port to which your vnc client should be able to directly connect.
The password is "secret".

  $ remote-viewer vnc://`docker-compose port selenium 5900`

If you opted to manually run the tests, you than can start the test from your bash shell that
we started earlier:

  $ pytest -v -x --pudb test_realm_dialog.py

The --pudb flag will open a debugger in case of an error or exception.
