    *about:blocking*

    the blocking with a fixed delay could lead to the problem, that when
    a server is offline, the server will be retried after a short delay.
    Looking at the relevant functions next (S) and block (b) we have the
    following event sequence with a constant delay between the retries.

    ----------------------------------------------------------> timeline
          S     S    b    S    b    S    b    S    b    S   S

    * the sequence ( S -> S ) indicate that the server has been reachable
      in the first request.

    What required is, is that we remember if the previous state already has
    been blocked - the block_indicator

    ----------------------------------------------------------> timeline
          S     S    b    S    b    S    b    S    b    S   S
    in    0     0    0    1    0    1    0    1    0    1   0
    out   0     0    1    0    1    0    1    0    1    0   0

    as we can see, that if the next():S gets the input 1, it knows, that
    the former request was blocked.

    But this helps nothing as the next():S always resets the block status
    to give a chance for a new request. The idea is now to just remember
    the former state and this could as well be used to aggregate the number
    of b->S sequences. Therefore we use a second state, the block_counter.
    Thus we have the tuple
             (block_indicator, block_counter)

    with the following algorithm

    * the func block():b
      always only sets the block_indicator (x,n) -> (1,n)

    * the func next():S  takes the block_indicator
      - if set, and adds it to the block_counter       (1,n) -> (0, n+1)
      - if not set, the block_counter will be reseted  (0,n) -> (0,0)

    the upper sequence would have the following counters:

    ----------------------------------------------------------> timeline
          s     S    b    S    b    S    b    S    b    S   S
    in    0,0  0,0  0,0  1,0  0,1  1,1  0,2  1,2  0,3  1,4  0,5
    out   0,0  0,0  1,0  0,1  1,1  0,2  1,2  0,3  1,4  0,5  0,0

    Now we can dynamically adjust the delay by the doubling the time
    based on the counter: delay + delay * 2**n  assuming a delay of
    30 seconds, this will result in a sequence of doubling delays

       0 -> 30                   =   0,5 Min
       1 -> 30 + 30 * 2^1 =   90 =   1,5 Min
       2 -> 30 + 30 * 2^2 =  150 =   2,5 Min
       3 -> 30 + 30 * 2^3 =  270 =   4,5 Min
       4 -> 30 + 30 * 2^4 =  510 =   8,5 Min
       5 -> 30 + 30 * 2^5 =  990 =  16,5 Min
       6 -> 30 + 30 * 2^6 = 1950 =  32,5 Min
       7 -> 30 + 30 * 2^7 = 3970 =  64,5 Min
       8 -> 30 + 30 * 2^8 = 7710 = 128,5 Min

    the max delay time should be limited to 8 which is ~2 hours
