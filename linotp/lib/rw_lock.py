""" Simple reader-writer locks in Python.

Python offers a number of useful synchronization primitives in the threading and Queue modules.
One that is missing, however, is a simple reader-writer lock (RWLock). A RWLock allows improved
concurrency over a simple mutex, and is useful for objects that have high read-to-write ratios
like database caches.

Surprisingly, I haven t been able to find any implementation of these semantics, so I rolled my
own in a module rwlock.py to implement a RWLock class, along with lock promotion/demotion. Hopefully
it can be added to the standard library threading module.
This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
