Dependencies
============================================

You need to install all dependencies listed in requirements.txt

I recommend creating a virtualenv and installing the dependencies there:

$ mkdir /opt/selenium-venv
$ virtualenv /opt/selenium-venv
$ source /opt/selenium-venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are not using a remote instance, you also need an X-Server on your
machine (or a virtual framebuffer such as xvfb) and Firefox or Chrome.

When using a virtual framebuffer set the $DISPLAY env variable before
executing the tests.


Server Configuration file
============================================

To run the LinOTP Selenium Tests you need a server.cfg file.

A default file for CentOS Server beggar is supplied: server_cfg.ini


Chrome driver
============================================

The Chrome Selenium driver (for Google Chrome or Chromium) is faster and is
therefore used by default.

You can specify a different driver by editing the config file (server_cfg.ini)
or using the option --tc=selenium.driver:firefox


To install the Chrome driver on Ubuntu (14.04 and higher) follow these steps:
$ sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver
$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver

On Debian jessie the the Chrome driver package is named 'chromedriver'.
$ sudo apt-get install chromedriver
$ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/chromium-browser/chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver

If the Chrome driver is not available in your package management system use
these steps:
$ cd /usr/local/bin/
Check for the latest Chromium driver:
  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
At time of writing 2.16 is the newest.
$ wget http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.16/chromedriver_linux64.zip
$ unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
$ rm chromedriver_linux64.zip
$ mv chromedriver chromedriver-2.16
$ chmod 755 chromedriver-2.16
$ ln -s chromedriver-2.16 chromedriver
$ cd /usr/bin/
$ ln -s chromium-browser google-chrome


Remote driver
============================================

The remote setting allows testing within a remote Selenium or
Selenium grid. It can also be used to test against the
standalone Docker images supplied by the Selenium project.

To enable remote, the configuration should add:

 remote = True

Optionally, a remote URL can be specified in the form:

 remote_url = http://selenium-grid:4444/wd/hub

The driver setting will be used to determine which driver is
requested from the remote instance.


Execution
============================================

To execute all tests:

 $ nosetests --tc-file=server_cfg.ini

To execute all tests in one file:

 $ nosetests --tc-file=server_cfg.ini test_create_useridresolvers.py

It is possible to overwrite some specific configuration settings as follows:

 $ nosetests --tc-file=server_cfg.ini --tc=<SECTION>.<NAME>:<VALUE>

See the configuration file for the parameters that can be set.

For example, to execute tests by connecting to a remotely running linotp instance:

 $ nosetests --tc-file=server_cfg.ini --tc=linotp.host:10.76.124.35

An example to execute tests in a single file using the trace module to show the
time at each step of the tests:

 $ python -m trace -g --trace --ignore-module=os,sys,re --ignore-dir=/usr/lib \
	/usr/bin/nosetests -s --tc-file=server_local.ini -v \
	--logging-filter=-requests.packages.urllib3.connectionpool \
	--debug=selenium.webdriver.remote.remote_connection \
	test_manage.py
