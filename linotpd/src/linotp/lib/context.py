    context_stack_trace is a contextmanager that is used to track usage
    of other context managers (such as request_context_safety). It pushes
    a manager_id onto a thread local stack in its entering block and pops
    it on exit.

    usage:

    @contextmanager
    def my_manager():
        with context_stack_trace('my_manager'):
            # do entering
            yield
            # do exiting

    This way you can check which context managers are active at the
    moment.

    To prevent accidental nesting of managers with the same id, you
    can set the parameter allow_nesting to False
