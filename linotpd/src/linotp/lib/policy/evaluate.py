    policy evaluation engine

    the policy evaluation is defined by an access request like:
        {'scope': 'admin', 'user': 'Hugo@realm'}
    which is checked against all policies. As result the list of all
    matching policies is returned.

    for refactoring the current policy evaluation

      getPolicy()

    could be replaced by three simple steps: by starting the policy class
    and adding the filters

        pe = PolicyEvaluator(Context.policies)
        pe.set_filters(param)

    followed by the evaluation:

        matching_policies = pe.evaluate()

    For post post processing more filters could be added - be aware filters are
    named and could be overwritten - and the evaluation could be made on an
    policy set:

        pe.set_filters({'client': '192.168.178.1'})
        pe.evaluate(previous_policies)

    [
     Currently the filter only return a boolean value, but this could be
     extendend to be a tuple of (match, exact or wildcard) which will help
     to determin the most precise policy
    ]

    [
     In addition to the categorization exact match/ wildcard match the initial
     set of policies for a request should be made. The request specific policy
     set will be determined at request start match for the primary access
     vector, which should be the:

       user, client, time and in some cases the realm
