Template: linotp/apache/activate
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Do you want to run LinOTP via Apache2?
 LinOTP 2 can be run within a webserver - here Apache2 - or via a paster start script.
 It is recommended to run LinOTP via the Apache2 webserver.
 This means that a SSL virtual host is activated and the mod_wsgi is loaded.
 You might then want to modify /etc/apache2/sites-available/linotp to suite your needs as far as authentication is concerned.

Template: linotp/apache/admin_password
Type: password
_Description: Password for LinOTP 'admin' account:
 LinOTP runs within the apache webserver. For authentication there is a user 'admin'.
 Here you may specify his password.
 If you want to do more detailed authentication or maybe do authentication
 with client certificates, you need to edit the apache configuration manually.

Template: linotp/apache/ssl_create
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Do you want to create a self signed certificate?
 When LinOTP runs within apache2, you should talk to the server via SSL on port 443.
 So you need a certificate for the server, which can be created now. (By the way: if
 you need to run apache2 with ssl on another port, you need to configure apache2
 manually.)

Template: linotp/tokendb/dbtype
Type: select
Choices: MySQL, none
_Description:  What SQL database do you want to use for the token database?
 LinOTP stores its token data in a SQL database.
 You may now choose the token database backend that is used by LinOTP. If you want to configure it manually,
 since you want to use another backend like Microsoft SQL server or Oracle you need to choose 'none' and than edit
 the file /etc/linotp/linotp.cfg manually.
 Please note, that SQLite can not be used with Apache2!

Template: linotp/tokendb/dbname
Type: string
Default: LinOTP2
_Description: Name of the token database:
 Here you may choose the name of the token database.

Default: localhost
_Description: Database hostname:
 Here you may choose the hostname of the computer where the database is located.

Template: linotp/tokendb/dbuser

 Here you may choose the name of the database user. This user needs to be created already and have access
 to the database. The user will not be created by this config.

Template: linotp/tokendb/file

Template: linotp/mysql/ask_createdb
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Do you want to create the LinOTP database, now?
 It seems that you have the mysql server and client installed. But the database that you configured
 for LinOTP is not created, yet.
 It might also be, that you entered the WRONG CREDENTIALS to access the database!
 If you got the necessary credentials, (root account for mysql database) and if you are sure,
 that the database does not exist, yet, the database can be created for you, now!

Template: linotp/mysql/ask_rootpw
Type: password
_Description: mysql root password:
 To create the token database for LinOTP on the MySQL server, you need to
 provide the password of the mysql root user. (This is not the system root
 account).

Template: linotp/mysql/ask_createtables
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Do you want to create the LinOTP tables in the database, now?
 Good. It seems that you already created the token database. Within the database
 LinOTP needs some tables, that may be created now. You may also create the tables
 later by issuing the command: flask init-db

Template: linotp/mysql/tables_exist
Type: text
_Description: Database connection works. Tables alreay exist!
 The database connection was tested successfully. The tables
 are already created!

Template: linotp/sqlite/ask_createdb

_Description: Create new token.db and overwrite old data?
 The token database SQLite file already exists. Do you want to overwrite this file? All data will be lost!

Template: linotp/postgres/no_configuration
Type: text
_Description: Bummer.
 LinOTP will be configured for the use of the postgress database.
 But you need to setup the postgres database yourself. So please create
 the database and the database user with your preferred postgres tools.
 Then create the tables in the database by issuing the command flask
 init-db
