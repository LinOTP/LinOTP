Template: linotp/apache/activate
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Do you want to run LinOTP via Apache2?
 LinOTP 2 can be run within a webserver - here Apache2 - or via a paster start script.
 It is recommended to run LinOTP via the Apache2 webserver.
 This means that a SSL virtual host is activated and the mod_wsgi is loaded.
 You might then want to modify /etc/apache2/sites-available/linotp to suite your needs as far as authentication is concerned.

Template: linotp/apache/admin_password
Type: password
_Description: Password for LinOTP 'admin' account:
 LinOTP runs within the apache webserver. For authentication there is a user 'admin'.
 Here you may specify his password.
 If you want to do more detailed authentication or maybe do authentication
 with client certificates, you need to edit the apache configuration manually.

Template: linotp/apache/ssl_create
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Do you want to create a self signed certificate?
 When LinOTP runs within apache2, you should talk to the server via SSL on port 443.
 So you need a certificate for the server, which can be created now. (By the way: if
 you need to run apache2 with ssl on another port, you need to configure apache2
 manually.)
