Description: Server Core of the LinOTP 2 authentication solution
 LinOTP is an open solution for strong two-factor authentication with One Time
 Passwords.
 LinOTP 2 is also open as far as its modular architecture is concerned.
 LinOTP 2 aims not to bind you to any decision of the authentication protocol
 and it does not dictate you where your user information should be stored.
 This is achieved by its new, totally modular architecture.
