LinOTP is a modular and open source project that lets you choose from various

of not locking you into any particular authentication method, protocol or
user information storage, LinOTP provides libraries, utilities and APIs to let
you customize your authentication processes.

Additional components such as the LinOTP authentication modules or the LinOTP
administration clients make it easy to integrate into your environment.
