LinOTP multi-database upgrade configuration:

Support the up and downgrade of the LinOTP databases
for linotp (Config and Token++), audit and openid.

When using alembic from commandline, make sure to use the correct
sqlalechemy.url's in the alembic.ini file, which are in the sections
linotp, audit and openid. With the correct alembic.ini settings you can
then use

    alembic upgrade head

You can as well use for this the offline mode:

    alembic upgrade head --sql

which will be answerd by a set generated sql file, for each database
definiton (audit, linotp, openid)


In the context of LinOTP the updates would be triggerd from the websetup.py,
by

    flask init-db

the sqlalchemy.url of your linotp.ini will replace the urls in the alembic.ini
file.
